hey boys,

this code is chaotic af, lol.

feel free to manipulate tf out of

really looking for a nice photo gallery and some general code cleaning and fixing.

really bad practice on this one so far.

- fix social media image links and css responsize sizing
- fix @media query placement and implementation
- fix hamburger on mobile
- fix all other mobile / responsize conflicts

and just finish the dang things.

have the domain and pw's etc. and will do a filezilla upload once we have anything worth pushing.

thanks for any assistance in advance.

feel free to do any pushes to the repository for me to implement.

and feel free to reach out with any questions at any time as i'd be happy to help and/or learn.
